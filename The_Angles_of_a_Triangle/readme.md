# [The Angles of a Triangle](https://js.checkio.org/mission/triangle-angles/)

The mission is in Collecting Mode. In order to see solutions of other users, you should share your own solutions first.

You are given the lengths for each side on a triangle. You need to find all three angles for this triangle. If the given side lengths cannot form a triangle (or form a degenerated triangle), then you must return all angles as 0 (zero). The angles should be represented as a list of integers in **ascending order**. Each angle is measured in degrees and rounded to the nearest integer number (Standard mathematical rounding).![enter image description here](https://js-static.checkio.org/media/task/media/c07c563875124150b668a6ac862797c9/triangle-angles.png)

**Input:** The lengths of the sides of a triangle as integers.

**Output:** Angles of a triangle in degrees as sorted list of integers.

**Example:**

```
triangleAngles(4, 4, 4) == [60, 60, 60]
triangleAngles(3, 4, 5) == [37, 53, 90]
triangleAngles(2, 2, 5) == [0, 0, 0]
```

**How it is used: **This is a classical geometric task. The ideas can be useful in topography and architecture. With this concept you can measure an angle without the need for a protractor.

**Precondition: **
0 < a,b,c â‰¤ 1000
